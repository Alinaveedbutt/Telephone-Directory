# Telephone-Directory
This is a simple console based Address Book system built in C++ that lets you manage student contact information. It allows you to insert, update, delete, search, and list student records, each containing an ID, name, address, and phone number. Records can be searched by either ID or name. The system runs in a menu loop and stores all data temporarily in memory. I made this project as it was useful for learning basic oop, arrays, and user input handling in C++.
